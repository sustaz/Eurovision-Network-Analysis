Here some indications about the execution of Python Notebooks.

1. In the folder datas there are all the files that have to be uploaded       
before the execution of the notebooks.   

2. 'Cleaning_Eurovision.ipynb' needs only the xlxs file (However it is useful 
to generate new dataframes if you want to extrapolate years before 2017). The 
Dataframes from 2017 to 2019 are already created into the 'datas' folder.

3. 'SNA_Eurovision_Analysis_Aspromonte_Romito.ipynb' needs all the files      
contained into 'datas' folder to complete all the execution, 
except for the xlxs file.
